What would fingers do if they no longer had anything to scroll?

The poem highlights the parallel, yet often forgotten, relationship between the
infinite scroll interface and MONEY, drawing attention to the unpaid labor
that the billions of fingers of the human species have been enlisted to engage
in since the 2010s. Poor fingers: often the thumb, sometimes the index finger
and sometimes the index and middle fingers together, laboring day and night with
no compensation for the millions of kilometers of swipes and scrolls which
they engage in during their waking hours.

The poem calls attention to the mental processes that accompany scrolling:
boredom, tired mind, the desire to find something, anything, that sparks
something within, something that intrigues or inspires. After all, our fingers
and our hands are an excellent tool to reach for when boredom overwhelms
the mind. They say that our hands are what distinguishes us from our closest
relative, the ape.

The more you scroll, the more text is generated onto the page. Perhaps the truly
radical way to evolve ourselves beyond this current era of mental digital
overload would be to decouple ourselves entirely from platforms that thrive on
an ethos of infinitely scrollable content whose user-generated content is
created because users desire likes, desire followers, desire attention and
desire content to kill time and to soothe bored minds that do not know what to
do with the time on their hands, and that no longer know what to do with the
hands themselves.

The longer you scroll, the darker the screen becomes, eventually making the
reading impossible. We find ourselves no longer motivated to scroll. Finally,
think the fingers! A rest! Silly human, finally they stopped using us for
scrolling. I wonder what they will have us do instead of scrolling?

Some ideas and suggestions for beginners on what to do with hands: crafts,
crochet, knitting, quilting, drawing, painting, sculpting, fishing, fixing things,
whittling, sewing, playing guitar, playing piano, playing bass, playing violin,
playing a tuba, writing with a pencil, cooking, baking, tending to plants,
petting a cat, coding, typing, writing and so on and so forth.
It is really only a question of imagination!
